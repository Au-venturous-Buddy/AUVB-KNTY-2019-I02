Tapsi ni Vivian is not your usual karinderya. Step inside and the interiors makes you feel that itâ€™s more of a restaurant than your typical cafeteria. While the air-conditioning there may not work as it should be, at least you are compensated for by the smell of the delicious comfort food that you would usually encounter in other tapsihans and bulaluhans throughout the Philippines.

And by the smell of the food served there, the dishes at Tapsi ni Vivian are definitely out of the ordinary.
