<h3>Tapsilog</h3>
After a long wait...here come's Tapsi ni Vivian's famous Tapsilog! To be honest with you, it's the best Tapa I've ever tasted! It's quite saucy, and the taste is a perfect balance of sweet and sour. Couple that with the fried rice, the sunny side-up egg, and most especially that Pink Vinegar, the taste is indeed one of a kind! And here's an added bonus: Tapsi ni Vivian also sells their tapa for you to take, prepare, and cook at home!
