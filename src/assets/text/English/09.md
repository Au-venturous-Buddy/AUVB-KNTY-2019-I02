<h3>Crabsilog</h3>
Next is the Crabsilog, and at this point, I have to confess that I'm actually allergic to crustaceans, so I'll just narrate it from my mother's description of tasting it. She said that the Crabsilog has the natural taste of crab (that is, no extenders), but she could sometimes sense bits of crab shell in the stuffing. It's delicious, but be careful when chewing, and my dad enjoyed it...YUMMY! ðŸ™‚
