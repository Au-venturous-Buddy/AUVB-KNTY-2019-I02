<h3>Assorted Puto and Kuchinta</h3>
Lastly, Tapsi ni Vivian has a store where you can buy Filipino pastries, one of which is this Assorted Puto and Kuchinta. But for me, the bite-sized Puto and Kuchinta just tastes ordinary, and that the Colored Putos tastes no different from the plain ones. And to be honest, the cheese topping does not help matters, either. But it's good to try (even my mother liked the Kuchinta!). Who knows, you might love it! ðŸ™‚

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
In all, if you are indeed craving for home-style Filipino cuisine, then you should look no further than Tapsi ni Vivian. While their downsides are that the Filipino pastries they are selling are not really that special (except probably for their cheese pies, which I was not able to try), plus the possibility of slow service (it just so happened that there was a huge crowd that time), the truth is, their Tapsilog and their other -silog dishes are definitely worth the wait! What's more, the restaurant's interiors will make you feel as if you're enjoying their dishes like your home-cooked meals at home.
