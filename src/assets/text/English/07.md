<h3>Nilsilog</h3>
The Tapsilog is definitely the signature dish of Tapsi ni Vivian, but it's not the only dish the restaurant is famous for! They are also known for their Bulalo, which, for me, is actually something to think about for those with high blood ðŸ™‚ (because of that very big bone marrow). So, for the health-conscious out there who would like to experience something like it at Tapsi ni Vivian, look no further than the Nilsilog! A hearty soup filled with tender red meat and fresh green pechay, when paired with the fried rice and sunny-side up egg, this will surely make up your day!
