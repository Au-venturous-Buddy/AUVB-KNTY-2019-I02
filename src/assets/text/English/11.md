<h3>Buko Juice</h3>
For a refreshing drink (and dessert) to wash down all the fatty -silog goodness, look no further than ordering Buko Juice! At Tapsi ni Vivian, your Buko Juice comes in an actual Buko fruit, and when you are finished slurping all that refreshing juice, you can have it opened and devour the meat as a dessert!
